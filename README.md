Simple invoice project


To start development on this project just copy the repository and you are pretty much good to go i used vscode's Live server extension to see how the project worked.


In this project I focused on learning typescript that is why i pushed both the typescript and javascript files I should've pushed them to different branches but it is too late now and I don't want to delete this repo and start over because all my commits would be gone. And this project is all about those commits. The project itself is a simple site that takes in a couple parameters compiles them into a sentence and writes out those sentences from all the data put in and outputs them to the "Invoice list".
You can also sort the list.
